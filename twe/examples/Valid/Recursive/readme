   Documents that you can find in this folder are here to show the JaWE ability
to support external package cross-references. Packages contained within these
documents have no other meaning but to show external package cross-references.

   Open any of these documents (M1 - M8) and notice that the every branch of
package hierarchy tree is expanding until it comes to the package already
contained in that branch.

   Also, because of cross-referenced external packages, if you enter the
applications or participants item from package menu or toolbar of main package
or any of external packages, you will see that it displays applications (
or participants) from all packages.
