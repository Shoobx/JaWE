   This is the modification of example given in WfMC document WfMC TC-1016-X -
"Interface 1: Process Definition Interchange Q&A and Examples".

   The example is modified to show the most of JaWE possibilities (using of
entities from referenced external packages, putting set of activities into block
activity, using extended attributes, defining data types and using it to define
some workflow relevant data, defining formal parameters of processes and passing
actual parameters from SubFlow activities that reference these processes ...).

   To see all of this, you have to open the document Business_Example.xpdl. The
package contained within this document contains 3 processes. Activities from
these processes use participants from externally referenced package contained
within Participant_Repository.xpdl, applications from externally referenced
package contained within Application_Repository.xpdl and processes from
externally referenced package contained within Process_Repository.xpdl.

   The main process from this package is Sales Order Processing, and SubFlow
activities from this process references other processes from this package and
from package defined within Process_Repository.xpdl

   It is interesting to notice that you can remove external packages
Participant_Repository and Application_Repository, because package
Process_Repository also references these packages, so the main package
gets the references to these packages (which applications and participants main
package uses) through the Process_Repository package.
