   These examples show a cases with various use of conformance classes -
NOT_BLOCKED, LOOP_BLOCKED, FULL_BLOCKED. According to this, there are
three examples. Some of processes in the xpdl's are valid, and some invalid.
The overall documents are invalid (regarding to the specified package
conformance class)

   "NotBlocked.xpdl" represents example with no Graph Conformance restrictions
(which means that "Not Blocked" graph conformance class is set).

   "LoopBlocked.xpdl" shows a processes with LOOP_BLOCKED Graph Conformance.
There are two processes where one has activities which form a cyclic graph
(which is not allowed on that conformance level) and second is valid acyclic
graph.

   "FullBlocked.xpdl" has a various processes for demonstration of FULL_BLOCKED
graph conformance level. Processes demonstrate the various cases (Simple process
which does and which doesn't satisfy a FULL_BLOCKED conformance level, processes
where one or more splits don't have corresponding join because of type mismatch,
process in which some 'And' splits haven't conditional outgoing transitions and
in which 'Xor' splits have conditional outgoing transitions but with otherwise
outgoing transitions
