3. Limited Transfer Rights 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may transfer all your rights to use the Software to another person or legal entity provided that: (a) you also transfer each of this Agreement, the Software and all other software or hardware bundled or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, updates and prior versions, and all copies of font software converted into other formats, to such person or entity; (b) you retain no copies, including backups and copies stored on a computer; and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions upon which you legally purchased a license to the Software.

4. Pre-Release Product Additional Terms 
If the product you have received with this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software ("Pre-release Software"), then this Section applies. To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this Section shall supersede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. You acknowledge that the Software is a pre-release version, does not represent final product from Together, and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS", AND TOGETHER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OF ANY KIND EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WHERE LEGALLY LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, TOGETHER'S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S.$50) IN TOTAL. You acknowledge that Together has not promised or guaranteed to you that Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, that Together has no express or implied obligation to you to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software and that Together may not introduce a product similar to or compatible with the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, you acknowledge that any research or development that you perform regarding the Pre-release Software or any product associated with the Pre-release Software is done entirely at your own risk. During the term of this Agreement, if requested by Together, you will provide feedback to Together regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports. If you have been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, your use of the Software is governed by such agreement.

5. Warranty and Limitation of Liability 
(a) Limited Warranty. Together warrants that (a) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt, and (b) any support services provided by Together shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to you by Together, and Together support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you. To the extent allowed by applicable law, implied warranties on the Software, if any, are limited to ninety (90) days.

(b) Customer Remedies. Together's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Together's option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet Together's Limited Warranty and which is returned to Together with a copy of your receipt. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

(c) No Other Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TOGETHER AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

(d) Limitation Of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TOGETHER OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF TOGETHER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, TOGETHER'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR U.S.$50.00; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO AN TOGETHER SUPPORT SERVICES AGREEMENT, TOGETHER'S ENTIRE LIABILITY REGARDING SUPPORT SERVICES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT. Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such states and jurisdictions, Together's liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

(e) Infringement Claims. Together will indemnify and hold you harmless and will defend or settle any claim, suit or proceeding brought against you that is based upon a claim that the content contained in the Software infringes a copyright or violates an intellectual or proprietary right protected by United States or European Union law ("Claim"), but only to the extent the Claim arises directly out of the use of the Software. You must notify Together in writing of any Claim within ten (10) business days after you first receive notice of the Claim, and you shall provide to Together at no cost with such assistance and cooperation as Together may reasonably request from time to time in connection with the defense of the Claim. Together shall have sole control over any Claim (including, without limitation, the selection of counsel and the right to settle on your behalf on any terms Together deems desirable in the sole exercise of its discretion). You may, at your sole cost, retain separate counsel and participate in the defense or settlement negotiations. Together shall pay actual damages and costs awarded against you (or payable by you pursuant to a settlement agreement) in connection with a Claim to the extent such damages and costs are not reimbursed to you by insurance or a third party, to an aggregate maximum of US$1,000. If the Software or its use becomes the subject of a Claim or its use is enjoined, or if in the opinion of Together's legal counsel the Software is likely to become the subject of a Claim, Together shall attempt to resolve the Claim by using commercially reasonable efforts to modify the Software or obtain a license to continue using the Software. If in the opinion of Together's legal counsel the Claim, the injunction or potential Claim cannot be resolved through reasonable modification or licensing, Together, at its own election, may terminate this Agreement without penalty, and will refund to you on a pro rata basis any fees paid in advance by you to Together. THE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES TOGETHER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.
 
6. Term and Termination 
This Agreement may be terminated (a) by your giving Together written notice of termination; or (b) by Together, at its option, giving you written notice of termination if you commit a breach of this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days after notice from Together. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you must cease all use of the Software, destroy all copies then in your possession or control and take such other actions as Together may reasonably request to ensure that no copies of the Software remain in your possession or control.
 
7. General Provisions 
If there is a local subsidiary of Together in the country in which the Software was obtained, then the local law of the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is located shall govern this Agreement. Otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Thailand. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior written and oral understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any notice or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall have been properly given by either of us to the other if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight courier to the address shown on Together's Web site for Together and the address shown in Together's records for you, or such other address as the parties may designate by notice given in the manner set forth above. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and our respective heirs, personal and legal representatives, affiliates, successors and permitted assigns. The failure of either of us at any time to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same or any other term of this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a document in writing signed by both of us. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by either party, the other shall have all applicable equitable as well as legal remedies. The Software and its related documentation may not be exported or reexported in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act and its implementing regulations or the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Software was obtained. Each party is duly authorized and empowered to enter into and perform this Agreement. If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent allowed by law. The parties knowingly and expressly consent to the foregoing terms and conditions.
