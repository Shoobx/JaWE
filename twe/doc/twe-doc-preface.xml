  <para><link xlink:href="http://www.together.at/prod/workflow/twe"

  is a visual tool for creating, managing and reviewing process definitions
  stored in WfMC XPDL syntax, using BPMN graphical notation.</para>

  <para>Put simple, Together Workflow Editor allows you to quickly create or
  view XPDL workflow definition files, check and store them for the further
  use. Once a definition is proven valid, it can be referenced by new
  definitions, thus shortening the time and effort needed to define workflow
  processes or imported into workflow engines capable of XPDL for
  execution.</para>

      <title>Why Should a Business Use Workflow ?</title>

      <para>The Evolution of Workflow Workflow Management consists of the
      automation of business procedures or "workflows" during which documents,
      information or tasks are passed from one participant to another in a way
      that is governed by rules or procedures. Workflow software products,
      like other software technologies, have evolved from diverse origins.
      While some offerings have been developed as pure workflow software, many
      have evolved from image management systems, document management systems,
      relational or object database systems, and electronic mail
      systems.</para>

    <title>Open source</title>

    <para>Together Workflow Editor is available as an Open Source as the
    Enhydra JaWE (Java Workflow Editor) project under the GPL V3
    license.</para>

    <para><link xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jawe"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Enhydra JaWE</link> is an <link

    hosted by <link xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SourceForge</link> , with the
    goal to deliver a production quality tool for graphical creation and
    viewing of WfMC XPDL process definitions. It results from real world
    projects in which the painful task of writing XML with general purpose XML
    editors had to be done again and again. This project is developed mainly
    by employees of <link xlink:href="http://www.together.at"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Together Teamsolutions Co.,
    Ltd</link> but also contains lots of input and improvements from the many
    users worldwide. Enhydra JaWE has a rapidly growing community and is also
    integrated in other open source projects like <link

    <title>This book's audience</title>

    <para>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity with XML and
    workflow. Even if you just know what processes and activities are, youâ€™re
    in good shape. Although this book provides basic introductions to key
    concepts, it may not suffice as your only tutorial about XPDL, XML, and
    workflow systems.</para>

    <para>Readers of this book are typically developers, workflow modelers and
    workflow system administrators.</para>

    <para>Some sections in this book describe certain environments like
    Microsoft Windows or Linux, although there is nothing about Together
    Workflow Editor that makes it unsuitable for the Mac or any other
    environment of your choice, as long as the defined software prerequisites
    (basically a JRE - Java Runtime Environment 1.8) are met.</para>

    <para>Together Teamsolutions Co., Ltd has been active for many years
    primarily in the area of workflow, database and document management
    solutions.</para>

    <para>In addition to the organizational and implementation services, these
    application areas are supplemented by the operation of solutions (system
    rollout, 24x7 hotline, training) as well as product development,
    consulting services (business process analysis and modelling),
    publications and presentations. The associated topics needed for real
    world projects, e.g. imaging, OCR, host integration, archiving, computer
    telephone integration, digital signatures, backup, performance tuning,
    reporting, systems administration and hardware sizing are also covered,
    continuously maintained and expanded.</para>

    <title>Enhydra</title>

    <para>The Enhydra.org project has its focus on E-Business middleware
    software. It now consists of many developers from over 50 countries. Many
    of these are able to offer commercial products, support, consulting and
    training.</para>

    <para>Enhydra.org started with Enhydra, the first and leading Open Source
    Java/XML application server. It was initially created by Lutris
    Technologies, Inc. which already disappeared from the market. After 4
    years in development it was open sourced on Janurary 15th 1999. They named
    the technology "Enhydra" after the California sea otter (Enhydra Lutris) -
    a popular inhabitant of Santa Cruz.</para>

    <para>Big parts of Enhydra development are now sponsored by Together
    Teamsolutions Co., Ltd located in Thailand. One of the outcomes of this
    sponsorship is Enhydra JaWE / Together Workflow Editor.</para>

    <title>JaWE</title>

    <para>JaWE - Java Workflow Editor - is the Open Source project of Together
    Workflow Editor. It is fully useable to edit, view and save complete XPDL
    files and licensed under GPL V3. Sources are publicly available in the

    <title>WfMC - The Workflow Management Coalition</title>

    <para>Founded in August 1993, the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) is
    a non-profit, global organization of adopters, developers, consultants,
    analysts and university/research groups engaged in Business Process
    Management (BPM). Workflow or BPM is the technology that supports people
    to do their work. Resulting benefit is more efficiency, traceability,and
    quality improvements.</para>

    <para>WfMC creates and contributes to process related standards and
    educates on the benefits of process automation. WfMC is the only standards
    organization that concentrates purely on process. WfMC created XPDL and
    Wf-XML and had influence on BPMN, OMG workflow interface, ASAP and many
    other process related standards.</para>
