  <title>Extended Attribute Reference</title>

  <para>TWE uses XPDL ability to store some additional information through
  extended attributes. TWE might add special extended attributes to package,
  external package, workflow process, activity and transition elements.</para>

  <para>Extended attribute that can be added to any custom main XPDL object
  (Activity, Application,DataField, Transition, WorkflowProcess, Package,
  etc.) is:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>JaWE_TYPE - it specifies the custom type Id of the element</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Extended attributes added for package element are:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>EDITING_TOOL - used to mark that XPDL was edited by TWE</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>EDITING_TOOL_VERSION - stores information about TWE version</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>JaWE_CONFIGURATION - stores information about TWE configuration
      used to create XPDL</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>In the versions before 4.x, before we switched to XPDL 2
  specification, there were extended attributes that were used by TWE's Graph
  component in order to hold the information about the graphical properties of
  elements, such as position, orientation, order, ...</para>

  <para>These attributes are not used by TWE any more, since graphical
  information is now stored in corresponding XPDL 2 specification
  elements.</para>

  <para>However, these attributes are important when TWE 4.x opens TWE 3.x or
  older XPDL files, and affect the conversion from XPDL 1 to XPDL 2.</para>

  <para>Here is a list of those "old" extended attributes:</para>

  <para>The ones that were added to workflow processes element are:</para>

  <itemizedlist condition="demo-details">
    <listitem>
      <para>JaWE_GRAPH_BLOCK_PARTICIPANT_ORIENTATION - information about
      orientation of participants (swim-lanes) in activity set's graph</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem condition="demo-emptytext">
      <para>JaWE_GRAPH_WORKFLOW_PARTICIPANT_ORIENTATION - information about
      orientation of participants (swim-lanes) in worfklow process's
      graph</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem condition="demo-emptytext">
      <para>JaWE_GRAPH_BLOCK_PARTICIPANT_ORDER - holds information about
      participant order for activity sets in this process</para>

    <listitem condition="demo-emptytext">
      <para>JaWE_GRAPH_WORKFLOW_PARTICIPANT_ORDER - holds information about
      participant order for workflow process</para>
