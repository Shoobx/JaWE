  <title>Installation guide</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Getting the binaries</title>

    <para>The latest binary packages of Together Workflow Editor can be
    downloaded from <link
    xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jawe/files"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SourceForge</link></para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>

    <para>The only prerequisite to be able to run TWE on Windows or Linux
    system is Java JRE 1.8 installed on the machine.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>There are several binary packages for Windows and Linux operating
    systems that can be used to install TWE.</para>

    <para>If TWE is installed on Windows using <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe</emphasis> package, just follow the setup
    procedure. The similar is with <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.noarch.rpm</emphasis> package on Linux.</para>

    <para>If TWE is installed from <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.zip</emphasis> or <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.tar.gz</emphasis> package on Windows/Linux
    respectivly, the packages should be un-packed, and in the root of the
    folder where they are unpacked, configure script should be executed. If
    JAVA_HOME environment variable exists, configure script can be executed
    without parameters, otherwise it should be called with a parameter
    specifying JAVA_HOME value, e.g:</para>

    <para><emphasis>configure -jdkhome c:\jdk1.8.0_20</emphasis></para>

    <para>This will create proper <emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis> script
    in bin directory that should be used to run TWE.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Silent Installation</title>

    <para>TWE has possibility to silently install via <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe </emphasis>file. To do that, rename the
    <emphasis role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties.txt</emphasis> file
    comming with TWE distribution into <emphasis
    role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties</emphasis>, put it into the same
    folder with the <emphasis role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe</emphasis>, and
    normally start the installation. During the installation, there will be no
    dialogs asking you to chose Java, place to install, etc. This information
    is taken from <emphasis role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties</emphasis>
    file. Here is the content of that file, with the properties you should
    modify to customize your installation:</para>

    <programlisting># Where to install Together Workflow Editor (default value is C:\Program Files\twe-x.y-z)
inst.dir=C:\Program Files\twe-4.5-1

# Path to local java installation (obligated - has no default value)
jdk.dir=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_20

# Startup menu name. (default value - Together Workflow Editor x.y-z)
