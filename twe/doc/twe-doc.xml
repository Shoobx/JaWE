    is a visual tool for creating, managing and reviewing process definitions
    stored in WfMC XPDL syntax, using BPMN graphical notation.</para>

    <para>Put simple, Together Workflow Editor allows you to quickly create or
    view XPDL workflow definition files, check and store them for the further
    use. Once a definition is proven valid, it can be referenced by new
    definitions, thus shortening the time and effort needed to define workflow
    processes or imported into workflow engines capable of XPDL for
    execution.</para>

        <title>Why Should a Business Use Workflow ?</title>

        <para>The Evolution of Workflow Workflow Management consists of the
        automation of business procedures or "workflows" during which
        documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to
        another in a way that is governed by rules or procedures. Workflow
        software products, like other software technologies, have evolved from
        diverse origins. While some offerings have been developed as pure
        workflow software, many have evolved from image management systems,
        document management systems, relational or object database systems,
        and electronic mail systems.</para>

      <title>This book's audience</title>

      <para>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity with XML
      and workflow. Even if you just know what processes and activities are,
      you’re in good shape. Although this book provides basic introductions to
      key concepts, it may not suffice as your only tutorial about XPDL, XML,
      and workflow systems.</para>

      <para>Readers of this book are typically developers, workflow modelers
      and workflow system administrators.</para>

      <para>Some sections in this book describe certain environments like
      Microsoft Windows or Linux, although there is nothing about Together
      Workflow Editor that makes it unsuitable for the Mac or any other
      environment of your choice, as long as the defined software
      prerequisites (basically a JRE - Java Runtime Environment 1.8) are
      met.</para>

      <title>What is Together Workflow Editor ?</title>

      <para>Together Workflow Editor (TWE) is a graphical editor for creating,
      editing, managing and reviewing WfMC XPDL process definition
      files.</para>

      <para>Workflow management is an evolving technology with lots of vendors
      claiming their approach is the best. We have chosen an approach which
      relies on WfMC and XPDL, thus supporting efforts to establish the
      standard. Together Workflow Editor is based on version 2.1 of the XPDL
      XML schema published by WfMC.</para>

      <para>The editor makes creating and editing XPDL easy. It represents all
      XPDL elements graphically through property panels and a graph component
      using BPMN graphical notation, to give the user a better understanding
      and an overview of the process definitions. Various functions help in
      finding specific activities, participants, applications, errors in the
      model, etc.</para>

      <para>The final output of the editor is an XML file (using the
      standardized WfMC XPDL schema) which can then be interpreted and
      executed by all WfMC XPDL compliant workflow engines.</para>

      <para>Together Workflow Editor accomplishes three main goals:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Reading of WfMC XPDL files (no matter from which tool they
          initially come from) from the filesystem or from the Wf-XML
          server</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Graphical representation and guided editing/modelling of
          process definitions</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Writing WfMC XPDL process definition XML files to the
          filesystem or to the Wf-XML server</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>History, Presence and Future Goals</title>

      <para>Before version 4.x, Together Workflow Editor was XPDL 1 editor
      that coverd the whole XPDL 1 Meta-Model. It was the best open-source
      (and we believe also the best of all) editor which allowed any vendor to
      create the XPDL 1 based workflow processes for their workflow engines.
      It was used by many vendors to (graphically) design their process
      definitions. Beside that, it was always the example for other
      implementors of such editors to see how to correctly interpret XPDL
      specification.</para>

      <para>Beside the core features that allows anyone to easily model XPDL
      processes, the flexibility and configurability of the editor, that
      includes configuration by only changing the existing component's
      properties, branding, and writting a special "configuration" modes for
      an editor, makes TWE powerful, and easily adjustable for the usage with
      any specific workflow engine.</para>

      <para>The version 4.x brings XPDL 2 and BPMN support. Although not fully
      covering XPDL 2 and BPMN, TWE now allows users to use the old powers of
      the editor and new BPMN notation which goal is to standardize graphical
      process representations, and thus making them uniform accross different
      editor tools, and understandable by the users knowing BPMN
      standard.</para>

      <para>The great feature of this new version is that it automatically
      converts XPDL 1 process definitions into XPDL 2 definitions, which
      minimizes the efforts of the migration to XPDL 2. Editor currently
      supports the sub-set of XPDL 2 specification necessary to conform to
      "simple" BPMN requirements.</para>

      <para>In the future, editor will support more and more of BPMN and XPDL
      2 specification, but we will always make our focus to first implement
      things that provide the modeler writting the workflow definitions for
      the real life human workflow scenarios.</para>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>The only prerequisite to be able to run TWE on Windows or Linux
      system is Java JRE 1.8 installed on the machine.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>There are several binary packages for Windows and Linux operating
      systems that can be used to install TWE.</para>

      <para>If TWE is installed on Windows using <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe</emphasis> package, just follow the setup
      procedure. The similar is with <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.noarch.rpm</emphasis> package on Linux.</para>

      <para>If TWE is installed from <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.zip</emphasis> or <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.tar.gz</emphasis> package on Windows/Linux
      respectivly, the packages should be un-packed, and in the root of the
      folder where they are unpacked, configure script should be executed. If
      JAVA_HOME environment variable exists, configure script can be executed
      without parameters, otherwise it should be called with a parameter
      specifying JAVA_HOME value, e.g:</para>

      <para><emphasis>configure -jdkhome c:\jdk1.8.0_20</emphasis></para>

      <para>This will create proper <emphasis role="bold">run</emphasis>
      script in bin directory that should be used to run TWE.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Silent Installation</title>

      <para>TWE has possibility to silently install via <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe </emphasis>file. To do that, rename the
      <emphasis role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties.txt</emphasis> file
      comming with TWE distribution into <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties</emphasis>, put it into the same
      folder with the <emphasis role="bold">twe-x.y-z.exe</emphasis>, and
      normally start the installation. During the installation, there will be
      no dialogs asking you to chose Java, place to install, etc. This
      information is taken from <emphasis
      role="bold">twe-x.y-z.silent.properties</emphasis> file. Here is the
      content of that file, with the properties you should modify to customize
      your installation:</para>

      <programlisting># Where to install Together Workflow Editor (default value is C:\Program Files\twe-x.y-z)
inst.dir=C:\Program Files\twe-4.5-1

# Path to local java installation (obligated - has no default value)

    <title>User Interface</title>

    <para>The Together Workflow Editor user interface consists of several
    parts. The order and the number of the displayed parts depend on the
    actually used configuration. This chapter explains the default
    configuration layout.</para>

    <para>Right below the title line of the editor window you will see the
    main menu, the main tool bar and the info bar. The rest of the window
    contains different components. The components are placed in the
    corresponding are depending on their type.</para>

    <para>Each component is responsible either for providing a different view
    of the WfMC XPDL elements, for displaying some additional information
    about XPDL elements (such as validation problems) or for displaying the
    result of some search.</para>

    <para>There are two areas on the left hand side: The upper area (marked as
    "Special Area") contains the <emphasis>Graph overview</emphasis>, the
    <emphasis>External package relations</emphasis> and the
    <emphasis>Transient package pool</emphasis> components. The lower area
    (marked as "Tree Area") contains the tree type components
    <emphasis>Navigator</emphasis> and <emphasis>Package
    tree</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>There are also two areas on the right hand side: The upper area
    (marked as "Main Area") contains the <emphasis>Graph</emphasis> and the
    <emphasis>XPDL View</emphasis> components. The lower area (marked as
    "Other Area") contains the <emphasis>Properties</emphasis>,
    <emphasis>Search</emphasis>, <emphasis>Problems</emphasis><emphasis>,
    WfXML</emphasis> and LDAP components.</para>

    <para>(NOTE: by right-clicking on the tab you are able to close some
    component's view or to move it from one area to another)</para>

    <para>See <xref linkend="togwecontroller.properties"/> for details about
    the configuration of the main frame.</para>

    <para>The rest of this chapter explains all these editor parts in

      <para>Transient packages are always available to the editor user
      (independently of the main package that is currently being edited) and
      the editor user can always copy elements (such as commonly used
      Activities and Transition structures, Applicatons or Participants
      definitions, etc.) from the transiently referrenced package into the
      currently edited package. XPDL Packages imported as transient are
      neither being validated for errors nor are these transient referrences
      stored in the current XPDL file. They are just shown for your
      convenience during modelling work. If a transient package is referencing
      other packages the user must be aware that the referenced packages won't
      be imported automatically.</para>

      commonly needed XPDL elements for copying them into the XPDL package you
      are editing. This feature is typically used for copying certain workflow
      design patterns from a pattern pool into processes. Predefined common
      workflow patterns can be found in the Together Workflow Editor
      installation directory "...\examples\valid\WorkflowPatterns\".</para>

      <para>You should be aware that there is a major difference in reusing
      XPDL elements from external packages and copying XPDL elements from
      other (transiently loaded) XPDL packages. Common subflows, application

      <para>The Graph provides all functions to handle lanes (representing
      participants), activities and transitions. All standard editor functions
      like insert, delete, move and select are supported.</para>

      <para>When new Workflow Process is created, TWE automatically creates a
      Pool for that process, and generates a new Graph representing this
      workflow process. This graph contains only a swimlane representing Pool.
      The first thing that need to be added/drawn are the lanes (a swimlanes
      representing the participant). When at least one (swim)lane is visible
      you can add activities, artifacts, transitions and associations into the
      graph.</para>

      <para>New elements are inserted into the graph in two steps. First
      select the button of choice in the graph toolbar to change the mouse
      cursor into the appropriate insert mode. Then click into the graph to
      insert the selected element. The mouse cursor will remain in the current
      insert mode until you click the right mouse button, press the ESC key on
      your keyboard or switch to another mode by selecting a different button
      in the graph toolbar.</para>

      <para>Inserting transitions and associations into the graph is somewhat
      different: Transitions' begin and end points must be activities, and
      associations' begin/end points must be activity and artifact. Clicking
      on the empty background of the graph while inserting a
      transition/assocation will insert a graphical break/routepoint. If
      insertion of a transition/association is started and the right mouse
      button or the ESC key is pressed, the current insert operation is
      cancelled and the mouse cursor stays in transition/association insert
      mode.</para>

      <para>Elements in the graph are selected by simply clicking on them with
      the left mouse button. You can select a group of elements by clicking
      the left mouse button on the empty background of the graph and dragging
      a rectangle around some elements or by using the SHIFT or CTRL key
      during left mouse clicks on the individual elements.</para>

      <para>To move elements to a new location just drag them with the left
      mouse button whereever you like.</para>

      <para>Double clicking on a graph element opens the property dialog for
      the element (except for block and subflow activities for which the
      appropriate graph will be opened).</para>

      <para>A right mouse click on an element in the graph will open the
      context popup menu of the element. The content of the context popup menu
      depends on which element was clicked on:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The empty background represents the process itself and only
          the Paste action can be performed to copy elements from the internal
          clipboard to the selected location.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Activities and Artifacts will show the standard edit
          functions. You can cut, copy, delete or edit properties of the
          selected activity/artifact, select related transitions/associations,
          or set color and size of the graphical object.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Transitions and Associations will also allow cut/copy/paste
          actions but conditionally (if connecting activities/artifacts are
          selected). You can also add a new break point, remove an existing
          one, delete it, edit transition/association properties, change the
          transition/association style, execute action to select related
          activities/artifacts, or set color of graphical object</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Lanes can be removed, deleted, edited or repositioned in the
          graph. The color of the lane can be changed as well.</para>

          <para>Common expression lane (shown as special swimlane in the
          graph) can be associated with a new performer expression.</para>

          <para>Be aware that there is a fundamental difference between
          removing a lane and deleting it:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>When lane is removed, it is removed from the selected
              process/activity set graph but it is still present in the XPDL
              model/package. However all the activities contained in the lane
              will be removed from the current graph.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>When lane is deleted, it is being deleted from the entire
              XPDL model/package but the activities contained in a lane won't
              be deleted from the model. They will be placed into the Graph's
              special lane called <emphasis>Free text expression
              </emphasis>lane.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For Gateways, Artifacts, Start and End events, one can also
          set (text) label location to Top/Bottom/Left/Right.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As mentioned, when the graph is empty (e.g. when a new process is
      created, and only Pool for this process is displayed) the first thing to
      be added/drawn is a lane representing the participant. When at least one
      lane is visible activities, artifacts, transitions and associations can
      be inserted into the graph.</para>

      <para>When inserting new lane into the graph using the toolbar buttons,
      the new participant on the package level is created, and its type is
      "Role". To change the participant type double click on the swimlane
      title to get its property panel.</para>

      <para>The lanes for already existing participant can be inserted by
      using the choice button <inlinemediaobject>

            <imagedata fileref="Images/lanesselect.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject> from the top of the graph component. The lane
      will be inserted at the bottom of the Pool (or at the bottom of the
      already selected lane - this will be nested lane in that case).</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Free text expression lane</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="bold">Common expression lane</emphasis> are not
      representing participants but it is a special visualization of performer
      expressions for activities.</para>

      <para>The Graph represents activity performers as swimlanes. When an
      activity is inserted or moved into a particular swimlane, it's performer
      will be updated to the participant represented by the swimlane. In the
      case of Common expression and Free text expression participants the
      activity's performer will be set to the expression defined as a property
      of the graph's common expression participant swimlane object. When the
      activity is inserted or moved into the free text expression participant
      any expression can be set for the activity performer field but by
      default performer expression won't be defined.</para>

      <para>Together Workflow Editor allows you to <emphasis
      role="bold">nest</emphasis> lanes thus making possible to visually
      represent organizational structure. To nest one lane into another,
      select the parent lane and then create new lane either by selecting the
      participant it will represent using the lane choice button

        <title>How to show transition conditions vs. names in the
        graph</title>

        <para>As shortly listed above, the graph can hide or show transition
        condition text, or even use transition's name when chosen to display
        the text in the graph.</para>

        <para>To show/hide transition's text in the design time use
        <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="Images/showtransitioncondition.gif"
                         format="GIF"/>
            </imageobject>
          </inlinemediaobject> and <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="Images/hidetransitioncondition.gif"
                         format="GIF"/>
            </imageobject>
          </inlinemediaobject> icons from the toolbar.</para>

        <para>To configure if the text should be shown or hidden by default
        when editor is opened, use the following entry from<emphasis>
        togwegraphcontroller.properties</emphasis> file for the selected
        editor conifiguration (mode):</para>

        <programlisting>Graph.ShowTransitionCondition = false</programlisting>

        <para>If you set the value to <emphasis>true</emphasis>, the text will
        be shown, otherwise it will be hidden by default.</para>

        <para>To configure if the transition's condition or transition's name
        text should be shown use the following property from the same
        file:</para>

        <programlisting>Graph.ShowTransitionNameForCondition = true</programlisting>

        <para>The value <emphasis>true</emphasis> means that transition's name
        will be shown, otherwise the transition's condition will be
        shown.</para>

        <note>
          <para>This property can't be changed in the design time.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The following sample shows graphically what does it mean. First,
        here is the property panel of one transition from the graph:</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>As you can see, the condition of this transition is
        <emphasis>!var_boolean_decision.booleanValue()</emphasis> and the name
        is <emphasis>No</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>If we setup graph not to show the transition text, the following
        is the picture how it will look like:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Graph - hidden transition's text</title>

          <mediaobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>If we configure to show transition's condition as text it will
        look like:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Graph - show transition's condition text</title>

      <title>XPDL View</title>

      <para>The XPDL view provides an XPDL text view of the selected elements.
      It shows the structure of the selected XML element as it will be saved
      in the XPDL file. Every time the selection is changed or a selected
      element is being updated, the XPDL View is automatically updated
      also.</para>

      <para>If the selected element is a whole XPDL package then the XPDL View
      displays the whole package definition in the exact form as it will be
      written into the XPDL file (when the document is saved). Otherwise the
      XPDL View will display the part of the XPDL which holds the definition
      of the selected element. So, when a particular process is selected, the
      XPDL view displays the process definition part of XPDL as it will be
      written to the XPDL file, etc.</para>

      <para>The following examples show different XPDL Views depending on the
      element type that is currently selected:</para>

      <programlisting condition="demo-configuration">HideElements.XMLTablePanel.ExtendedAttributes.Name = SpecEA EASpec</programlisting>

      <para>You are able to customize so called "table" panels, used to

      <para>There is another customization possible for the so called "combo

      parent element will be selected (e.g. if error is with actual parameter,
      clicking on element will select actual parameter, while clicking on some
      other column will select activity) - as already explained, sometimes
      these two are the same.</para>

      <para>On the other hand, double-clicking opens a dialog for editing
      problematic element.</para>

      <para>There is also a possibility to sort entries by the column - just
      click to the column header, and entries will be sorted by this
      column.</para>

      <para>Problem component background color could be changed through
      problemnavigator.properties file. (BackgroundColor = R=?,G=?,B=?)</para>

      <para>The advantage of using "LDAP defined participants" is that one can
      connect the LDAP server of its organization and create processes using
      the real user/group logins for participant Ids. When the engine enacts
      such a process, it could also browse the LDAP server for the certain
      users/groups, so you do not have to do "participant to real user
      mapping".</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>XPDL Elements</title>

    <para>This chapter describes how TWE works, corresponding to WfMC
    (Workflow Management Coalition) specifications (<link
    xlink:href="http://www.wfmc.org"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.wfmc.org</link>). WfMC
    provides an interface for workflow process definition. The interface
    defines a common meta-model for describing the process definition and XML
    schema for interchange of process definitions - <acronym>XPDL</acronym>
    (XML Process Definition Language). The focus is on XPDL schema elements,
    and TWE's property panels for editing them.</para>

    <para>TWE is a tool for <emphasis>Process Definition</emphasis> modelling.
    The final output of this process modelling is a XPDL output file, which
    can be interpreted at runtime by the workflow engine(s). TWE accomplished
    three main goals:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Graphical representation of process definition</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Export of process definitions to XPDL</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Import of any valid XPDL and its graphical
          representation</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>TWE handles one (main) package at a time, although it displays in a
    read-only mode all the external packages of the main package (and all the
    external packages of external packages and so on). Main TWE component
    window is labeled Graph. It is the graphic representation of workflow
    process or activity set, depending on what is currently selected.</para>

    <para>Participants are represented with swim lines which encapsulate other
    smaller blocks (don't be confused; participants can be horizontally or
    vertically oriented). Those blocks represent activities.</para>

    <para>Lines which connect activities are transitions. Graph specific
    elements are Start and End bubbles. These elements are not the part of
    WfMC specification, although they appear in the resulting XPDL file as
    extended attribute elements.</para>

    <para>The rest of XPDL elements can be accessed and modified through their
    panel properties.</para>

            <entry align="justify" valign="middle">The workflow process
            definition interface defines a common interchange format, which
            supports the transfer of workflow process definitions between
            different products. A workflow process definition, generated by
            TWE, is capable of interpretation in different workflow run-time
            products. The principles of <emphasis>Process Definition
            Interchange</emphasis> are based on Meta-Model framework. This
            meta-data model identifies commonly used entities within a process
            definition, their relationships and attributes. A variety of
            attributes describe the characteristics of this limited set of
            entities. Using this Meta-Model, TWE can transfer models using an
            XPDL as a common exchange format. Beside this interchange, TWE is
            also used for internal representation of process definitions. The
            whole concept is shown on the picture:</entry>

    <para>There is a mandatory minimum set of objects, which must be supported
    within XPDL. This "minimum meta-data model" identifies those commonly used
    entities within a process definition and describes their usage semantics.
    Extensibility is provided by the facility to encompass additional object
    attributes ("extended attributes") which can be included as extensions to
    the basic Meta-Model to meet the specific needs of an individual product
    or workflow system.</para>

    <para>Corresponding to the previous picture with concept of Process
    Definition Interchange, this chapter gives overview of Meta-Model entities
    (<emphasis>Meta-Model framework</emphasis>) and explains representation of
    these objects in TWE (<emphasis>Internal representation</emphasis>) with
    XPDL attributes (<emphasis>XML representation</emphasis>) that are defined
    in it.</para>

      <para>The meta-model identifies the basic set of entities and attributes

      <para>For each of the above entities, there is an associated set of
      attributes (some mandatory and others optional) which describe the
      characteristics of the entity. If there is a need of using an additional
      characteristics, "extended attributes" for various entities may be
      defined to allow extension of the scope of the Meta-Model in a
      controlled manner.</para>

      <para>All those entities except "Message Flow" and "Group" type
      artifacts are maintained by TWE. The current version of TWE is written
      as an XPDL 1 extension towards XPDL 2, and still does not support the
      whole XPDL 2 Meta-Model but only the parts necessary to support simple
      BPMN conformance, and still to allow workflow engines to execute XPDL 1
      "migrated" process definitions.</para>

      <para>"Resource Repository " is external to the workflow process
      definitions. In some complex processes, participant declaration may
      refer to a resource repository, which may be on Organisational Model
      (OM). WfMC Meta-Model specification defines a simple in-built (Minimal)
      Organisational Model or permits access to an externally defined OM. Note
      that XPDL specification does not define or require a resource
      repository.</para>

      <para>TWE works only with a <emphasis>Minimal Organisational
      Model</emphasis> so there is no external Organisational Model provided.
      In this model, there aren't any relationships between participants. TWE
      may refer (import) any external XPDL structure - <emphasis>External
      Package</emphasis>. That External XPDL file may contain whole
      Organisational Model, so that External Package can act like
      <emphasis>Resource Repository</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>As it is shown in the previous picture, minimal process model
      includes various entities whose scope may be wider than a single process
      definition. In particular the definitions of participants, applications
      and workflow relevant data may be referenced from a number of process
      definitions. The Meta-Model assumes the use of a common process
      definition <emphasis>Resource Repository</emphasis>. Repository holds
      the various entity types comprising the process definition. Within the
      repository itself and to support the efficient transfer of process
      definition data to/from the repository, the concept of a PACKAGE is
      introduced, which acts as a <emphasis>container</emphasis> for the
      grouping of common data entities from a number of different process
      definitions, to avoid redefinition within each individual process
      definition. Each process definition contained within the package will
      automatically inherit any common attribute from the process model
      container, unless they are separately re-specified locally within the
      process definition.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="Package">
      <title>Package</title>

      <para>It is possible to define several processes within one package,
      which may share the same tools (applications) and participants.</para>

      <para>The Package acts as a container for grouping together a number of
      individual process definitions and associated entity data, which is
      applicable to all the contained process definitions.</para>

      <para>You can chose to create one package per workflow process, which
      should contain all the necessary workflow processes as well as all the
      associated tools (workflow applications) and workflow participants.
      Another approach is to define just parts of one process definition or
      common parts of several processes within one package (e.g. a workflow
      participant list or a workflow application list), and then to reference
      it from other packages. Within a package, the scope of the definitions
      of some entities is global and these entities can be referenced from all
      workflow process definitions contained within the package. Those
      entities are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Process Definition,</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Participant Specification,</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Relevant Data</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>TWE provides a way to manage above listed entities (within one
      package). On <xref linkend="mainToolbarOrganization"/>, you can see
      where is the toolbar part for handling the properties of the selected
      Package.</para>

      <para>To create a new Package in TWE, you simply select File-&gt;New, or
      click appropriate button in the toolbar <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/new.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject> (the first button on the left). If you are
      currently editing some other XPDL file and there are some unsaved
      changes there, prior to creating a new Package, TWE will ask you if you
      want to save the changes.</para>

      <para>It is important to say that actions represented by buttons shown
      on the toolbar picture (and also corresponding menu items) are applied
      to the currently selected package, which can be the main one or one of
      the externally referenced packages.</para>

      <para>If you select the main package, you can modify its properties, but
      this is not possible for the external packages. Those external packages
      are read-only, and you can only read their properties.</para>

        <para>The Package Header keeps all information central to a package.
        By default, when you create a new Package, XPDL version will be 2.1
        (the version currently partially supported by TWE). If TWE reads a
        document that have XPDL version set to the value different then 2.1,
        it will report it as an warning. When new package is created,
        <emphasis>Vendor</emphasis> attribute is set to
        <emphasis>Together</emphasis> and <emphasis>Created</emphasis>
        attribute to the current date and time of creation in ISO-8601

      <title>Artifacts</title>

      <para>To satisfy additional modeling concepts that are not part of the
      basic set of flow elements (activities and transitions), BPMN provides
      the concept of Artifacts that can be linked to the existing Activity
      object through Associations. Thus, Artifacts do <emphasis
      role="bold">not</emphasis> affect the basic sequence flow, nor do they
      affect mappings to execution languages.Artifacts are used to show
      additional information about a Process that is not directly related to
      its sequence flow.</para>

      <para>At this point, BPMN provides three standard Artifacts: A Data
      Object, a Group, and an Annotation. TWE currently allows you to use the
      first two types of artifacts.</para>

      <para>An Artifact is a graphical object that provides supporting
      information about the Process or elements within the Process. However,
      as mentioned, it does <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> directly
      affect the flow of the Process. BPMN provides a specific graphical

      <para>In BPMN, a Data Object is considered an Artifact because it does
      not have any direct affect on the sequence flow of the Process, but it
      does provide information about what the Process does. That is, how
      documents, data, and other objects are used and updated during the
      Process. While the name - Data Object may imply an electronic document,
      it can be used to represent many different types of objects, both
      electronic and physical.</para>

      <para>As an Artifact, Data Objects generally will be associated with
      activities. An Association will be used to make the connection between
      the Data Object and the Flow Object. This means that the behavior of the
      Process can be modeled without Data Objects for modelers who want to
      reduce clutter. The same Process can be modeled with Data Objects for
      modelers who want to include more information without changing the basic
      behavior of the Process.</para>

      <para>The following is a sample of process modeled with an artifact
      showing the information about the document flowing from one activity to
      another:</para>

      <para>To specify that a certain component should be used in a runtime,
      you must define at least two properties:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The first property defines the component to add. E.g. to add
          Graph component, we would define something like:</para>

          <para><emphasis>Component.Add.GraphController=org.enhydra.jawe.components.graph.GraphController
          </emphasis></para>

          <para>The value of this property is the name of the Java class
          representing TWE component.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The second property defines settings to be used to configure
          the component. E.g. for the Graph component defined in 1), we would
          define something like:</para>

          <para><emphasis>Settings.GraphController =
          org.enhydra.jawe.components.graph.TogWEGraphControllerSettings</emphasis></para>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>The parameters that end with <emphasis>.ComponentOrder</emphasis>
      are used for setting tab order for each of the TWE frame sections
      (areas). E.g. to add Graph component to be initially the second one in
      the 'Main' tab, it should be something like:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Main.ComponentOrder = XPDLViewController
      GraphController</emphasis></para>

      <para>Note that parameters <emphasis>UpperStatus</emphasis> and

          <programlisting>FrameSettings = V; special H tree; main H other</programlisting>

          <para>which means that the frame will be first divided vertically.
          The left part of the frame will be divided horizontally, where
          <emphasis>special</emphasis> area will be in the upper and
          <emphasis>tree</emphasis> area in the lower part, and also the right
          part will be divided horizontally, where <emphasis>main</emphasis>
          area will be in the upper and <emphasis>other</emphasis> area in the
          lower part.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>MainDividerLocation</emphasis> - this property is a
          double value that defines the initial location for the main frame
          divider as a percentage of JSplitPane's size. In the example above,
          it is the vertical divider that divides the frame into the left and

      <para>There are a lot of parameters that are defining toolbar and
      menubar content and order, ...</para>

      <para>E.g. to change the order of menu items in the File menu, or to
      leave out some items, you can modify the following:</para>

      <para><emphasis>SubMenu.ActionOrder.File = NewPackage Open Reopen Close
      - Save SaveAs - @RecentFiles - Exit</emphasis></para>
    </sect1>

      <para>Here are described elements used in TWE: their types and
      information about them (what should be their color).</para>

      <para>For example, the following section defines the properties for an
      activity which type is <emphasis>BlockActivity</emphasis></para>

      <programlisting>#JaWETypes.ActivityType.Id.block = ACTIVITY_BLOCK
#JaWETypes.ActivityType.LangDepName.block = BlockActivityKey

#JaWETypes.ActivityType.Color.block = R=255,G=165,B=121
#JaWETypes.ActivityType.XPDLTemplate.block = 
</programlisting>

      <para>Changing the color used to represent this kind of activity will
      have effect only to the graph component.</para>

      <para>There is another advanced feature of TWE which can be utilized
      through jawetypes.properties file. You can define custom XPDL object
      types, and even provide the XPDL template fragment to define properties
      they should have. E.g. if you want to define new type of activity called
      loop activity, you can have the following configuration:</para>

      <para><programlisting>JaWETypes.ActivityType.Id.loop = ACTIVITY_LOOP
JaWETypes.ActivityType.LangDepName.loop = LoopKey
JaWETypes.ActivityType.Icon.loop = org/enhydra/jawe/samples/loopactivity/
images/loopactivity.gif
JaWETypes.ActivityType.Color.loop = R=255,G=155,B=15
JaWETypes.ActivityType.XPDLTemplate.loop = sampleactloop.xml</programlisting>where
      sampleactloop.xml have to be placed under templates subfloder of the
      configuration you are using. The content of sampleloop.xml file can be
      something like:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;Activity&gt;
   &lt;BlockActivity BlockId=""/&gt;
   &lt;ExtendedAttributes&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="LoopCondition" Value=""/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="LoopType" Value="While"/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="BackToPool" Value="false"/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="SetTemporary" Value="false"/&gt;
   &lt;/ExtendedAttributes&gt;
&lt;/Activity&gt;</programlisting>To define custom language strings, you
      should edit jawelanguagemisc.properties file in the target configuration
      folder, and add appropriate [key,value] pairs. For the previous example,
      you should add a only following [key,value] par:</para>

      <para><programlisting>LoopKey = Loop</programlisting>If you need
      language specific entries for other languages, you just put
      corresponding property file into the target configuration folder, and
      define the same property. E.g. you define jawelanguagemisc_de.properties
      file if you need German translation.</para>

      <para>This newly defined activity will automatically appear in the
      Graph's component toolbox ones you start TWE for this configuration
      mode.</para>

      <para>There are properties which can be adjusted to fine-tune the basic
      element property panels L&amp;F, such as alignment, TOP, BOTTOM, RIGHT,
      LEFT empty space in the panels, the width and height of the text boxes,

      <para>You are able to customize so called "group" panels, used to
      display some complex elements, in order to hide some complex element
      sub-elements. For example, in order not to display Activity's Id,
      Deadlines, Priority and Limit, you should set the property
      <emphasis>HideSubElements.XMLGroupPanel.Activity</emphasis> to the
      following value:</para>

      <programlisting>HideSubElements.XMLGroupPanel.Activity = Id Deadlines Priority Limit</programlisting>

      <para>You are able to customize which elements of some collection
      shouldn't be displayed within so called "table" panels. For example, if
      you don't want to display extended attributes which name attribute is
      "SpecEA" or "EASpec", you can define the property:<programlisting>HideElements.XMLTablePanel.ExtendedAttributes.Name = SpecEA EASpec</programlisting></para>

      <para>You are able to customize so called "table" panels, used to
      display some complex element collections, in order to specify which
      sub-elements will be shown as a table columns. For example, when
      displaying activities, you can specify to show Activity's Id, Name,
      Performer, Type, Start mode, Finish mode and Deadlines:</para>

      <para><emphasis>ShowColumns.XMLTablePanel.Activities = Id Name Performer
      Type StartMode FinishMode Deadlines</emphasis></para>

      <para>There is another customization possible for the so called "combo
      box" panel. Hence, you can define for which elements the combo box will
      be disabled (by default nothing is disabled). For example, if you want
      to disable combo boxes for displaying Activity's Performer and
      Transition's From and To properties, you should specify the
      following:</para>

      <programlisting>XMLComboPanel.DisableCombo = Performer From To</programlisting>

    <title>Customization</title>

    <sect1>
      <title>Need for customization</title>

      <para>In order to make the life easier for the XPDL developers, and to
      make developing of XPDLs less error prone, it could be a good idea to
      customize TWE. One way of customization can be introduction of new
      activity types (e.g. automated activities for sending e-mails with
      customized property panels for entering all the information, a special
      kind of deadline element, a special XPDL template for creating a new
      workflow process, ...).</para>

      <para>Thanks to its internal architecture, TWE can be easily customized
      in order to support these requirements.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Example - activity for sending an e-mail</title>

      <para>To illustrate previous statement, let's say that in all of our
      processes, we are intensivelly using Tool activity for sending
      e-mails.</para>

      <para>If we use standard TWE implementation, everytime we want to insert
      such activity in the process (e.g. via Graph component), we first need
      to insert a standard Tool activitiy using TWE's Graph component toolbox.
      After that, we need to open the property panel for the activity, go to
      the Type section, and create a new Tool for this activity. When new Tool
      is created, we need to edit it, where we need to select a reference to
      the Application definition for sending e-mails, and than to create as
      many ActualParameters for the Tool as there are FormalParameters for the
      Send E-Mail Application definition. And finally, we need to enter
      appropriate values for this ActualParameters (either a references to the
      variables, or some text expressions).</para>

      <para>You have to admit that there is a lot of work to do, and it can be
      quite anoying if you have to do it many times. Also, it is error
      prone.</para>

      <para>What we can do is to extend standard TWE functionallity, and to
      introduce a new type of an activity for sending e-mails, which will be
      the customization of the standard Tool activity. We can offer a new
      button in Graph's toolbar for creating such kind of an activity. This
      button would have a special icon, and e-mail-ing activity when inserted
      into graph would also have this icon to be diferentiated amongst others.
      Also, when such activity is created, its XPDL content would be
      automatically pre-filled, so it would always have a Tool which would
      reference the Application for sending an e-mails, and this Tool would
      already have a default values for all necessary ActualParameters. But
      this is not all, we can also offer a special property panel for entering
      e-mail parameters (ActualParameters) - e.g, we can have a combo-box with
      a list of e-mail addresses (which could be filled through the LDAP), we
      can have a text box for entering mail subject, and a text area for
      entering mail content.</para>

      <title>Available customizations</title>

      <para>TWE distribution comes with several customized configurations. You
      can switch from one configuration to another one if you select
      Settings-&gt;Configuration and select desired configuration. TWE will be
      re-configured to use selected configuration.</para>

      <para>Available configurations are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>default - default TWE configuration.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Shark configuration</title>

    <para>As described in previous chapter, it is often a good idea to
    customize TWE in a way to support the specifics of workflow engine where
    XPDL will be deployed.</para>

    <para>Shark configuration is customization that is targeting specifics of
    Shark engine (<link xlink:href="http://www.together.at/prod/workflow/tws"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Together Workflow
    Server</link>) where a certain XPDL restrictions are applied, special
    property panels for easy editing of shark specific extended attributes are
    provided, shark specific XPDL validation is present, etc.</para>

    <para>Configuration differences between "Default" and "Shark"
    configuration are done in two ways. First are differences done only by
    changing configuration in property files (as described in <xref
    linkend="configuration"/>), and the second are the differences done both
    by changing property file configuration and writting additional/extending
    existing Java code.</para>

    <para>Differences by changing the property file entries only are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Different L&amp;F background color (achieved by changing
        <emphasis>BackgroundColor</emphasis> property in all the property
        files for GUI components - we use yellow background instead of default
        white)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Hidding of XPDL elements that are not supported/used by Shark
        (achieved by adding/editing
        <emphasis>detailedpackagenavigator.properties</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>propertiespanelcomponent.properties</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>togweeditor.properties</emphasis> files).</para>

        <note>
          <para>Here we are also hidding shark specific extended attributes
          not to be visible in the property panel table or in the tree-view.
          This is because we are showing this attributes as they are native
          properties of corresponding elements (Activity, DataField,
          WorkflowProcess, Package)</para>
        </note>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>All other differences are done by both editing property files and
    adding/extending java code. Main changes related to property files are in
    togwebasic.properties where different (shark related) implemenations for
    different plug-in components are defined to be used. Next are the changes
    in jawetypes.properties where speciifc XML templates for different
    workflow elements and new application types (corresponding to Shark's tool
    agents) are defined. And finally, jawelanguagemisc.properties file is
    filled-in with necessary shark mode specific language dependent
    keys/values.</para>

    <para>There are also 3 additional configuration propery files in shark
    mode:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>shkappdefchoices.properties - here you can define possible
        application definitions (for tool agents) that will be shown as
        options in the GUI</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shkassmgrchoices.properties - here you can define possible
        assignment manager plug-ins that will be shown as options in the
        GUI</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shkconfigstringchoices.properties - here you can define possible
        configuration strings that will be shown as options in the GUI</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There is a special Java package <emphasis
    role="bold">org.enhydra.jawe.shark</emphasis> which contains different
    Java classes and resources (images). These classes together with
    configuration in property files are providing shark specific GUI which
    represents some extended attributes in a way intuitive for the XPDL
    modeler. They are also providing many additional things like inserting
    shark specific variables into different kind of expressions, and finally,
    they provide validation which forces you to comply to the shark rules. All
    in all, the editing of XPDL for shark workflow engine becomes much more
    easy and less error-prone.</para>

    <para>To better understand Shark configuration one should read <link
    xlink:href="http://www.together.at/prod/workflow/tws/manual"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Together Workflow Server User
    Manual</link>, especially the chapter <emphasis>XPDL Extended Attributes
    Usage</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Here we'll explain the specifics of Shark configuration by comparing
    a different property dialogs generated in this configuration to the ones
    generated in the Default configuration.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Difference in property dialog for Package element</title>

      <para>The first difference is representation of variable
      <emphasis>category</emphasis> as a normal attribute (like Id or Name).
      The second difference is representation of Script type element. In
      default configuration it is a text box where you can enter what ever you
      like. However, shark configuration uses combo-box which limits the
      options to 3 possible predefined types supported by Shark engine.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Next, shark configuration has 9 additional sections for
      representing extended attributes in an intuitive way, easy for
      editing.</para>

      <sect2 xml:id="packageworkflowengineconfig">
        <title>Workflow engine configuration section</title>

        <para>In this section, one can edit extended attributes for shark
        workflow engine kernel configuration and some of the plug-in
        configuration. In the picture below, left side shows extended
        attributes in Default configuration, and right side shows how are they
        represented in Shark configuration.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>There are 27 extended attributes in this section. The first
        (top-left) check-box <emphasis>Configure workflow engine?</emphasis>
        when un-checked removes all of them, and when checked allows you to
        edit their values in user-friendly way.</para>

        <para>E.g. instead of (when using Default configuration) pressing
        button to create new extended attribute with name
        <emphasis>UNSATISFIED_SPLIT_CONDITION_HANDLING_MODE</emphasis> and
        typing the value that has to be either
        <emphasis>FINISH_IF_POSSIBLE</emphasis>, <emphasis>IGNORE</emphasis>
        or <emphasis>ROLLBACK</emphasis> (which can be very error-prone) one
        can simply select the desired value (which is displayed in the
        language he is using) from the combo-box next to the label
        <emphasis>Unsatisfied split condition handling mode</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>The similar is for true/false value extended attributes like:
        USE_PROCESS_CONTEXT_ONLY, ALLOW_UNDEFINED_VARIABLES, TRANSIENT,
        DELETE_FINISHED, etc. Instead of writting attribute name and putting
        true or false for its value in Default configuration, in Shark
        configuration one just checks/un-checks appropriate check-box.</para>

        <para>For the <emphasis>ASSIGNMENT_MANAGER_PLUGIN</emphasis> extended
        attribute, the approach is to have editable combo-box where you can
        chose the name of one of existing shark's assignment manger plug-ins
        (delivered with project) or you can enter the full class name of your
        own assignment manager. For the existing ones, combo-box entry
        contains friendly name (defined in shkassmgrchoices.properties mapping
        property file in shark configuration folder) and as you can see on the
        left side of the picture (for the default mode), this friendly name is
        mapped to the full class name.</para>

        <para>For the
        <emphasis>ASSIGNMENT_MANAGER_DEFAULT_ASSIGNEES</emphasis> extended
        attribute, in Shark configuration one can add/remove/edit the entries
        in the <emphasis>Default assignees</emphasis> list control, whilest in
        Default configuration one should type the name of the extended
        attribute and then comma-separated values of entries.</para>

        <para>The text controls for defining MAX_ASSIGNMENT and
        WORKLOAD_FACTOR extended attributes in <emphasis>Workload related
        assignment manager configuration</emphasis> part are limiting the
        values you can enter to the digits only.</para>

        controls. When you add/edit attributes, the combo-box shows only
        allowed values which are not added yet. In the Default configuration
        one should type the name of the extended attribute and then
        pipe-separated values of entries which is very error-prone.</para>

        <title>Default error handler configuration section</title>

        <para>In this section, one can edit extended attributes used by
        shark's SMTPNewProcFileSysLog implementation of error handler. This
        handler has capability to send email, to write (XPIL) log about an
        error and to start pre-configured error process when tool agent
        activity error happens. Also, it can be configured what to do with the
        process/activity in the case tool agent activity error happens, the
        possible choices are to: "Kepp activity running", "Propagate" error,
        "Terminate activity" and "Terminate process". In the picture below,
        left side shows extended attributes in Default configuration, and
        right side shows how are they represented in Shark
        configuration.</para>

        <para>For the SMTP_LIMIT_HANDLER_SUBJECT_PROCESS and
        SMTP_LIMIT_HANDLER_CONTENT_PROCESS extended attributes, Shark
        configuration provides 4 special choice buttons on the right where one
        can use system variables, variables, configuration strings and xpdl
        strings by just clicking and selecting one.</para>

        <para>For the SMTP_LIMIT_HANDLER_ATTACHMENTS_PROCESS,
        SMTP_LIMIT_HANDLER_ATTACHMENT_NAMES_PROCESS,
        SMTP_LIMIT_HANDLER_DM_ATTACHMENTS_PROCESS one can add/remove/edit
        entries in table/list control. The entries for the attachment's
        content variable are limited to String and Schema type variables which
        are not already added. The ones for attachment's "name variable or
        expression", it is limited to String variables and one can also enter
        the expression (typically hard-coded string value). The ones for DM
        attachments are limited to String type variables which are not already
        added.</para>

        <para>In Shark configuration mode there is a powerful validation of
        these extended attributes. E.g. it is validated if all the variables
        referenced really exist and if their type is correct. Then also, if
        variable id changes, that change is automatically reflected in the
        content of extended attribute.</para>

        <title>XPDL string variables configuration section</title>

        <para>In this section, one can add/remove/delete so called XPDL string
        variables. These are Shark specific extended attributes which are
        interpreted as a special (static) string variables.In the picture
        below, left side shows several extended attributes representing these
        variables in Default configuration, and right side shows how are they
        represented in Shark configuration.</para>

        <para>So in Shark configuration these attributes are treated

    <para>In the versions before 4.x, before we switched to XPDL 2
    specification, there were extended attributes that were used by TWE's
    Graph component in order to hold the information about the graphical
    properties of elements, such as position, orientation, order, ...</para>

    <para>These attributes are not used by TWE any more, since graphical
    information is now stored in corresponding XPDL 2 specification
    elements.</para>

    <para>However, these attributes are important when TWE 4.x opens TWE 3.x
    or older XPDL files, and affect the conversion from XPDL 1 to XPDL
    2.</para>

      <para>Possible parameters for the configure script are:</para>

      <programlisting>configure              - Creates build.properties file with default values
                         for all possible parameters. It can work only if 
                         there is a default JAVA registered with the system.

                         re-branding application.
configure -language    - ONLY FOR WINDOWS. Used by NSIS when creating setup 
                         (normally used for rebranding). 
                         Possible values [English/Portuguese/PortugueseBR].

Multiple parameters can be specified at once.


Example:

configure -version 4.5 -release 1 -buildid 20120301-0808 -jdkhome C:/jdk1.8 -instdir C:/JaWE</programlisting>

      <para>The configure script will create/change the build.properties file
      based on the parameters provided. This file can also be manually changed
      to adjust your environment/parameters for building the project from the
      sources.</para>

      <para>Execute the make script with the buildAll target from the root
      directory of the project source. When the building process finishes, the
      project binaries will be in output/twe-[version]-[release]
      folder.</para>

      <para>Possible build targets for the make script are:</para>

      <para><programlisting>make help            - Displays Help screen

make buildNoDoc      - Builds and configures TWE without documentation
make buildDoc        - Builds documentation only
make debug           - Builds TWE JAR files with included debug information
make install         - Installs and configures TWE into directory defined 
                       by parameter install.dir in build.properties file. 
                       This parameter can be set by using command: 
                       configure -instdir PATH_TO_DIR.
                       It should be called only after make buildAll target 
                       is executed!
make clean           - Removes the output and distribution folder (in order 
                       to start a new compilation from scratch)
make distributions   - Builds and configures TWE with all documentations 
                       and creates distribution package

      <title>Packaging distributions</title>

      <para>Assuming that the environment is already configured as described
      previously, to create the project distribution packages, execute:</para>

      <para>On Windows, to have the resulting <!--JAR files and--> ".exe" file
      automatically signed, the file called <emphasis

      <title>Rebranding</title>

      <para>TWE build procedure enables you to create so called "branded"
      version of TWE distribution files.</para>

      <para>It means that at the end you can get the distribution files fully
      "branded" as if the product is under your own ownership. E.g. instead of
      calling the product "Together Workflow Editor", you can call it "XYZ
      Workflow Editor", and during the build procedure replace all other
      things neccessary for the "branding".</para>

      <para>To build branded product, first you have to configure TWE by
      executing the following configure command in %TWE_HOME% folder:</para>

      <para><programlisting>configure -rebranding true</programlisting>If you
      also want to use a different language in the windows setup wizard, you
      should execute e.g. the following:</para>

      <para><programlisting>configure -language Portuguese</programlisting></para>

      <para>NOTE: currently possible values are English, Portuguese and
      PortugueseBR.</para>

      <para>Then you can also specify the short name for the application, e.g.
      instead of the default "twe" you can specify "xyz":</para>

      <programlisting>configure -appname xyz</programlisting>

      <para>And the full name for the application, e.g. instead of default
      "Together Workflow Editor" you can specify "XYZ Workflow Editor":</para>

      <programlisting>configure -projectname "XYZ Workflow Editor"</programlisting>

      <para>Finally, you have to specify the branding folder where you will
      put your files that will be used for re-branding process:</para>

      <programlisting>configure -brandingdir d:/tmp/branding</programlisting>

      <para>You can copy the sample files from %TWE_HOME%/branding folder to
      that folder to see the sample branding files.</para>

      <para>There are several sub-folders in %TWE_HOME%/branding folder which
      content needs to be edited,removed or appended in order to rebrand the
      application distribution. The following table explains the meaning of
      the sub-folders and how can you perform TWE branding by changing their
      content:</para>

 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
