   # Now supporting XPDL 2.1 and BPMN
   # Using jxpdl.jar file, the output of Together XPDL Model(TXM)/jXPDL project. 
     This contains the XPDL 2 model classes that were previously the part of 
     Enhydra Shark (Together Workflow Server) project
   # Automatic migration of XPDL 1.0 files into XPDL 2.1 files:
      - Inserting pools and lanes for each workflow process definition
      - Migrating Ids for activities and activity sets - must be unique on the package level (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Tool activities into Task-Application activities, if there are more than one 
        tool for the activity - new activities get created and connected sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating activities (other than Route activities) with Join type different than XOR and Split 
        type different than AND by creating additional Route (gateway) activities that are
        containing those Join/Split types, and connecting them sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Route activities with different Join/Split type into two seperate activities and 
        connecting them sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating old Deadline's DeadlineCondition into DeadlineDuration sub-element, according to 
        new schema (done by TXM)

      - Removing FormalParameter Index attribute, according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating IsArray attribute value (of DataField element) from TRUE into true and from FALSE 
        into false, according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Activity's Start/Finish mode elements into appropriate attributes according to new 
        schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Activity's Performer element into Performers element according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating order of WorkflowProcess sub-elements(DataFields,Participants,Applications -> Participants,
        Applications, DataFields) (done by TXM)
        
   # Using BPMN graphical notation for Graph component

      - Support for Start and End event Activities
      - Support for Task-Application activities (Tool activities from XPDL 2.1 converted 
        into Task-Application activities)            
      - Support for Graphical notation elements that hold information about position, 
        color, etc. of the objects (removed extended attributes previously used for that purpose)
   # Introduced possibility to change graphical element colors and sizes (information 
     written into appropriate XPDL2.1 entities)

   # Removed wfmopen configuration since WfMOpen engine still does not support XPDL 2
   # Removed purexpdl configuration - does not make sense any more since TWE 4.x does not 
     use extended attributes for storing graphical information (standard XPDL 2 elements are used now)

   # Fixed: bug in handling of transient packages that appeared when you have transient
            package in the pool and you try to open XPDL from unexisting file - this
            caused all packages to unload from XMLInterface and after it happens it was
            possible to have two XPDLs with same Id in TWE.
   # Improved build procedure - added ant target to build release notes (community and prof)
