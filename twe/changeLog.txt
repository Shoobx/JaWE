     This contains the XPDL 2 model classes that were previously the part of 
     Enhydra Shark (Together Workflow Server) project
   # Automatic migration of XPDL 1.0 files into XPDL 2.1 files:
      - Inserting pools and lanes for each workflow process definition
      - Migrating Ids for activities and activity sets - must be unique on the package level (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Tool activities into Task-Application activities, if there are more than one 
        tool for the activity - new activities get created and connected sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating activities (other than Route activities) with Join type different than XOR and Split 
        type different than AND by creating additional Route (gateway) activities that are
        containing those Join/Split types, and connecting them sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Route activities with different Join/Split type into two seperate activities and 
        connecting them sequentially (done by TXM)
      - Migrating old Deadline's DeadlineCondition into DeadlineDuration sub-element, according to 
        new schema (done by TXM)

      - Removing FormalParameter Index attribute, according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating IsArray attribute value (of DataField element) from TRUE into true and from FALSE 
        into false, according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Activity's Start/Finish mode elements into appropriate attributes according to new 
        schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating Activity's Performer element into Performers element according to new schema (done by TXM)
      - Migrating order of WorkflowProcess sub-elements(DataFields,Participants,Applications -> Participants,
        Applications, DataFields) (done by TXM)

        into Task-Application activities)            
      - Support for Graphical notation elements that hold information about position, 
        color, etc. of the objects (removed extended attributes previously used for that purpose)
   # Introduced possibility to change graphical element colors and sizes (information 
     written into appropriate XPDL2.1 entities)
