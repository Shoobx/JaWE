ComponentNeedDescription=Build the document for Together java base project.
ComponentComment=FOP uses the standard XSL-FO file format as input; lays the content out into pages; then renders it to the requested output. One great advantage of using XSL-FO as input is that XSL-FO is itself an XML file; which means that it can be conveniently created from a variety of sources. The most common method is to convert semantic XML to XSL-FO; using an XSLT transformation.
