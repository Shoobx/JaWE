This is the readme file for JaWE source distribution

How to compile JaWE from sources
---------------------------------

1. edit build.properties file to set PATH to your JDK directory. You can use JDK1.4.2 or higher

   Optionally, instead of editing build.properties file you can execute configure script from the root.
   If you want to set specific JAVA version for building JaWE (different than the one registered with 
   your system) then execute:

      configure -jdkhome %JAVA_HOME%
   
   where JAVA_HOME is the path to your Java installation.
   
   
2. execute make script
   
      
When make process finishes, you will get JaWE binaries in output/twe-[version]-[release] folder.

      NOTE: After you build JaWE, and if you want to "move" your binaries to the 
            new location you need to execute:
   
               configure -instdir %INST_DIR%

            where INST_DIR is the place where you want to put shark binaries, and then

                  make install

In the root of the project, there are eclipse project files that can help you to 
configure JaWE project in eclipse.


How to build JaWE from sources (Linux build)
--------------------------------------------
== Requirements (Linux build)==
   1. Fedora 12 with
     -  bash,
     -  tar,
     -  make and
     -  java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel packages installed
   2. TWE source archive

== Build steps ==
   = Unpack sources
   = Change directory
   = Run configure
      Options to configure are:
          -jdkhome to specify JDK location
	  -debug
	  -optimize

   = Run make
      Make targets are:
        clean
	buildAll
	distributions

Described procedure has been prooved on Fedora 12, but nobody says it wouldn't 
work on other Linux flavors, provided equivalent prerequisites are met. 

Example (this one would produce RPM distribution package):
$ /bin/bash ./configure \
  --jdkhome=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk \
  version=3.1 \
  release=1
$ make distributions
