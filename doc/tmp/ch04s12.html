        component.</p><p>The following table shows the picture of how the graph

        type of the activity:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Images/act_no.jpg"></div></td><td>Manual (No implementation) activities are atomic

                Process definition within the subflow is entirely independent
                from the first one (where subflow activity resides). It has
                its own set of activities, internal transitions, participants,

                - e.g. activity pre- and post- conditions.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Icons for inserting different types of activities from the graph
        toolbox are the same as the ones included in the previously explained
        picture of the activities in the graph. For the manual activity, there
        is a toolbox icon <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/genericactivity.gif"></span>, for Tool activities <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/activitytool.gif"></span>, for subflow activities<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/subflowactivity.gif"></span>, for block activities <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/blockactivity.gif"></span> and for route activities <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/routeactivity.gif"></span>. Once selected, mouse cursor will show what
        type of object you'll insert. Activity is created using some default
        values for their properties, which typically are to be changed. Right
        clicking the object in the graph shows a context menu, and there is
        item representing action for getting property panel. Different than
        others, Block and SubFlow activities have additional menu item
        "descend into..." which is used to display the graph of the referenced
        ActivitySet/Workflow Process.</p><p>Beside this, TWE offers a special feature to select an Icon for
        particular activity. When you open activity's property panel, for the
        Icon entry you can select some of the additional Icons we offer (this
        list can be easily extended by putting more icons in
        tweactivityicons.jar file). The selected icon will appear instead the
        default one.</p><h4><a name="d0e4808"></a>Start and End Bubbles</h4><p>These are the special graphical objects which are the part of
        the Graph component.</p><p>Graph's toolbox icon for inserting Start object into graph is

        the graph::</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/bubble_start.jpg"></span> <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Images/bubble_end.jpg"></span></p><p>Although start and end bubbles aren't part of XPDL
        specification, there is a need to visually mark where the workflow
        process starts, and where it ends. Each of Start/End markers is can be
        connected to exactly one activity in the graph.</p><p>User can configure TWE not to use start/end bubbles, in which
        case starting and ending activities of the process are colored in
        special colors, also configured in the property file of the graph
        component (starting activities are considered the ones without
        incoming transitions or with only one incoming transition, which is
        also a circular transition. The similar stands for the ending
        activities).</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Activity_Subflow"></a>Activity property panel</h3></div></div></div><p>In this section are explained various property panels concerning
