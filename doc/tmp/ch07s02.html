      processes, we are intensivelly using Tool activity for sending
      e-mails.</p><p>If we use standard TWE implementation, everytime we want to insert
      such activity in the process (i.e. via Graph component), we first need
      to insert a standard Tool activitiy using TWE's Graph component toolbox.
      After that, we need to open the property panel for the activity, go to
      the Type section, and create a new Tool for this activity. When new Tool
      is created, we need to edit it, where we need to select a reference to
      the Application definition for sending e-mails, and than to create as
      many ActualParameters for the Tool as there are FormalParameters for the
      Send E-Mail Application definition. And finally, we need to enter
      appropriate values for this ActualParameters (either a references to the
      variables, or some text expressions).</p><p>You have to admit that there is a lot of work to do, and it can be
      quite anoying if you have to do it many times. Also, it is error
      prone.</p><p>What we can do is to extend standard TWE functionallity, and to
      introduce a new type of an activity for sending e-mails, which will be
      the customization of the standard Tool activity. We can offer a new
      button in Graph's toolbar for creating such kind of an activity. This
      button would have a special icon, and e-mail-ing activity when inserted
      into graph would also have this icon to be diferentiated amongst others.
      Also, when such activity is created, its XPDL content would be
      automatically pre-filled, so it would always have a Tool which would
      reference the Application for sending an e-mails, and this Tool would
      already have a default values for all necessary ActualParameters. But
      this is not all, we can also offer a special property panel for entering
      e-mail parameters (ActualParameters) - e.g, we can have a combo-box with
      a list of e-mail addresses (which could be filled through the LDAP), we
      can have a text box for entering mail subject, and a text area for
      entering mail content.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch07s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Customization&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Available customizations</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
