      software. It now consists of many developers from over 50 countries. You
      can count on the project group because it is backed by the Objectweb
      consortium, a truly open source oriented middleware consortium, and a
      number of big commercial sponsors. Many of these are able to offer
      commercial products, support, consulting and training.</p><p>The Enhydra.org Web site was initially created by Lutris
      Technologies, Inc. Starting from beginning of May 2002, ObjectWeb took
      over the sponsorship of the Enhydra initiative hosting. All Enhydra
      projects now use the ObjectWeb infrastructure and in particular the
      ObjectWeb Forge which is based on GForge.</p><p>Enhydra.org started with Enhydra, the first and leading Open
      Source Java/XML application server. It was initially created by Lutris
      Technologies, Inc. which already disappeared from the market. After 4
      years in development it was open sourced on Janurary 15th 1999. They
      named the technology "Enhydra" after the California sea otter (Enhydra
      Lutris) - a popular inhabitant of Santa Cruz.</p><p>Big parts of Enhydra development are now sponsored by Together
      Teaml&ouml;sungen EDV-Dienstleistungen GmbH. located in Europe (Austria,
      Serbia and Slovakia). One of the outcomes of this sponsorship is Enhydra
      JaWE, the open source part of Together Workflow Editor
      Professional.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01s10.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pr01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="pr01s12.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Together Teaml&ouml;sungen EDV-Dienstleistungen GmbH.&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;JaWE</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
