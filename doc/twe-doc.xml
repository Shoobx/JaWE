    Workflow Editor</ulink> is a visual tool for creating, managing and
    reviewing process definitions stored in WfMC XPDL syntax.</para>

    <para>Put simple, Together Workflow Editor allows you to quickly create or
    view XPDL workflow definition files, check and store them for the further
    use. Once a definition is proven valid, it can be referenced by new
    definitions, thus shortening the time and effort needed to define workflow
    processes or imported into workflow engines capable of XPDL for

        <title>Why Should a Business Use Workflow ?</title>

        <para>The Evolution of Workflow Workflow Management consists of the
        automation of business procedures or "workflows" during which
        documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to
        another in a way that is governed by rules or procedures. Workflow
        software products, like other software technologies, have evolved from
        diverse origins. While some offerings have been developed as pure
        workflow software, many have evolved from image management systems,
        document management systems, relational or object database systems,
        and electronic mail systems.</para>

      <title>This book's audience</title>

      <para>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity with XML
      and workflow. Even if you just know what processes and activities are,
      you’re in good shape. Although this book provides basic introductions to
      key concepts, it may not suffice as your only tutorial about XPDL, XML,
      and workflow systems.</para>

      <para>Readers of this book are typically developers, workflow modelers
      and workflow system administrators.</para>

      <para>Some sections in this book describe certain environments like
      Microsoft Windows or Linux, although there is nothing about Together
      Workflow Editor that makes it unsuitable for the Mac or any other
      environment of your choice, as long as the defined software
      prerequisites (basically a JRE - Java Runtime Environment 1.4) are
      met.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>What is Together Workflow Editor ?</title>

      <para>Together Workflow Editor is a graphical editor for creating,
      editing, managing and reviewing WfMC XPDL process definition
      files.</para>

      <para>Workflow management is an evolving technology with lots of vendors
      claiming their approach is the best. We have chosen an approach which
      relies on WfMC and XPDL, thus supporting efforts to establish the
      standard. Together Workflow Editor is based on version 1.0 of the XPDL
      XML schema published by WfMC.</para>

      <para>The editor makes creating and editing XPDL easy. It represents all
      XPDL elements graphically through property panels and a graph component
      to give the user a better understanding and an overview of the process
      definitions. Various functions help in finding specific activities,
      participants, applications, errors in the model, etc.</para>

      <para>The final output of the editor is an XML file (using the
      standardized WfMC XPDL schema) which can then be interpreted and
      executed by all WfMC XPDL compliant workflow engines.</para>

      <para>Together Workflow Editor accomplishes three main goals:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Reading of WfMC XPDL files (no matter from which tool they
          initially come from) from the filesystem or from the Wf-XML
          server</para>

    <title>The Graphical User Interface</title>

    <para>The Together Workflow Editor user interface consists of several
    parts. The order and the number of the displayed parts depend on the
    actually used configuration. This chapter explains the default
    configuration layout.</para>

    <para>Right below the title line of the editor window you will see the
    main menu, the main tool bar and the info bar. The rest of the window
    contains different components. The components are placed in the
    corresponding are depending on their type.</para>

    <para>Each component is responsible either for providing a different view
    of the WfMC XPDL elements, for displaying some additional information
    about XPDL elements (such as validation problems) or for displaying the
    result of some search.</para>

      certain XPDL packages in transient mode (see <link
      linkend="togwebasic.properties"><emphasis>togwebasic.properties</emphasis></link>)
      at startup to have access to most commonly needed XPDL elements for
      copying them into the XPDL package you are editing. This feature is
      typically used for copying certain workflow design patterns from a
      pattern pool into processes. Predefined common workflow patterns can be
      found in the Together Workflow Editor installation directory
      "...\examples\valid\WorkflowPatterns\".</para>

      <para>You should be aware that there is a major difference in reusing
      XPDL elements from external packages and copying XPDL elements from
      other (transiently loaded) XPDL packages. Common subflows, application
      or participant definitions should normally be reused by modelling
      externally referenced packages instead of copying definitions
      redundantly into other packages.</para>

      <para>The Graph provides all functions to handle participants,
      activities and transitions. All standard editor functions like insert,
      delete, move and select are supported.</para>

      <para>New elements are inserted into the graph in two steps. First
      select the button of choice in the graph toolbar to change the mouse
      cursor into the appropriate insert mode. Then click into the graph to
      insert the selected element. The mouse cursor will remain in the current
      insert mode until you click the right mouse button, press the ESC key on
      your keyboard or switch to another mode by selecting a different button
      in the graph toolbar.</para>

      <para>Inserting transitions into the graph is somewhat different:
      Transitions begin and end points must be activities. Clicking on the
      empty background of the graph while inserting a transition will insert a
      graphical break/routepoint. If insertion of a transition is started and
      the right mouse button or the ESC key is pressed, the current insert
      operation is cancelled and the mouse cursor stays in transition insert
      mode.</para>

      <para>Elements in the graph are selected with by simply clicking on them
      with the left mouse button. You can select a group of elements by
      clicking with the left mouse button on the empty background of the graph
      and dragging a rectangle around some elements or by using the SHIFT or
      CTRL key during left mouse clicks on the individual elements.</para>

      <para>To move elements to a new location just drag them with the left
      mouse button whereever you like.</para>

      <para>Double clicking on a graph element opens the property dialog for
      the element (except for block and subflow activities for which the
      appropriate graph will be opened).</para>

      <para>A right mouse click on an element in the graph will open the
      context popup menu of the element. The content of the context popup menu
      depends on which element was clicked on:</para>

          the graph) can be associated with a new performer expression.</para>

          <para>Be aware that there is a fundamental difference between
          removing a participant and deleting it:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>When a participant is removed, it is removed from the
              selected process/activity set graph but it is still present in
              the XPDL model/package. However all the activities contained in
              a swimlane representing the participant will be removed from the
              current graph.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>When a participant is deleted, it is being deleted from
              the entire XPDL model/package but the activities contained in a
              swimlane representing the participant won't be deleted from the
              model. They will be placed into the Graph's special swimlane
              called <emphasis>Free text expression
              </emphasis>participant.</para>

      <para>If a Graph is empty (i.e. when a new process is created) the first
      thing to be added drawn is a participant. When at least one participant
      swimlane is visible you can add activities and transitions.</para>

      <para>When inserting new participants into the graph, the default
      participant type is "Role". To change the participant type double left
      click on the swimlane title to get its property panel. Inserting new
      participants (as opposed to referencing existing ones) means creating a
      new participant on the selected process level.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Free text expression participant</emphasis>
      and <emphasis role="bold">Common expression participant</emphasis> are
      not participants in the sense of XPDL but a special visualization of
      performer expressions of activities.</para>

      <para>The Graph represents activity performers as swimlanes. When an
      activity is inserted or moved into a particular swim line, it's
      performer will be updates to the participant represented by the
      swimlane. In the case of Common expression and Free text expression
      participants the activity's performer will be set to the expression
      defined as a property of the graph's common expression participant
      swimlane object. When the activity is inserted or moved into the free
      text expression participant any expression can be set for the activity
      performer field but by default performer expression won't be
      defined.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Normal</emphasis> activity enables you to
      insert an activity that will be performed by a human (so called manual
      activity) - it will appear in the user's worklist.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Tool</emphasis> activity enables the
      definition of applications that are required for the enactment engine to
      run in order to perform the activity.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Subflow</emphasis> activity is a type of
      activity whose implementation is another workflow process
      definition.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Block</emphasis> activity executes an
      ActivitySet (set of self-contained activities/transition maps). It is
      something like an embedded subflow process.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Route</emphasis> activity does not implement
      any action. It is used for synchronization and conditional branching
      only.</para>

      <para>A transition binds two activities but it can also be a circular
      transition from a certain activity to itself. A straight line with an
      arrow pointing to the target object represents the transition in the
      Graph. The toolbar offers two kinds of transitions: A Condition
      transition (normal transition) or an exceptional transition. The type of
      a transition can be changed through its property panel.</para>

      <title>XPDL View</title>

      <para>The XPDL view provides an XPDL text view of the selected elements.
      It shows the structure of the selected XML element as it will be saved
      in the XPDL file. Every time the selection is changed or a selected
      element is being updated, the XPDL View is automatically updated
      also.</para>

      <para>If the selected element is a whole XPDL package then the XPDL View
      displays the whole package definition in the exact form as it will be
      written into the XPDL file (when the document is saved). Otherwise the
      XPDL View will display the part of the XPDL which holds the definition
      of the selected element. So, when a particular process is selected, the
      XPDL view displays the process definition part of XPDL as it will be
      written to the XPDL file, etc.</para>

      <para>The following examples show different XPDL Views depending on the
      element type that is currently selected:</para>

      other column will select activity) - as already explained, sometimes
      these two are the same.</para>

      <para>On the other hand, double-clicking opens a dialog for editing
      problematic element.</para>

      <para>There is also a possibility to sort entries by the column - just

      <para>The advantage of using "LDAP defined participants" is that one can

      the real user/group logins for participant Ids. When the engine enacts

    <title>XPDL elements</title>

    <para>This chapter describes how TWE works, corresponding to WfMC
    (Workflow Management Coalition) specifications (<ulink
    url="http://www.wfmc.org">www.wfmc.org</ulink>). WfMC provides an
    interface for workflow process definition. The interface defines a common
    meta-model for describing the process definition and XML schema for
    interchange of process definitions - <acronym>XPDL</acronym> (XML Process
    Definition Language). The focus is on XPDL schema elements, and TWE's
    property panels for editing them.</para>

    <para>TWE is a tool for <emphasis>Process Definition</emphasis> modelling.
    The final output of this process modelling is a XPDL output file, which
    can be interpreted at runtime by the workflow engine(s). TWE accomplished
    three main goals:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Graphical representation of process definition</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Export of process definitions to XPDL</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Import of any valid XPDL and its graphical
          representation</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>TWE handles one (main) package at a time, although it displays in a
    read-only mode all the external packages of the main package (and all the
    external packages of external packages and so on). Main TWE component
    window is labeled Graph. It is the graphic representation of workflow
    process or activity set, depending on what is currently selected.</para>

    <para>Participants are represented with swim lines which encapsulate other
    smaller blocks (don't be confused; participants can be horizontally or
    vertically oriented). Those blocks represent activities.</para>

    <para>Lines which connect activities are transitions. Graph specific
    elements are Start and End bubbles. These elements are not the part of
    WfMC specification, although they appear in the resulting XPDL file as
    extended attribute elements.</para>

    <para>The rest of XPDL elements can be accessed and modified through their
    panel properties.</para>

            <entry align="justify" valign="middle">The workflow process
            definition interface defines a common interchange format, which
            supports the transfer of workflow process definitions between
            different products. A workflow process definition, generated by
            TWE, is capable of interpretation in different workflow run-time
            products. The principles of <emphasis>Process Definition
            Interchange</emphasis> are based on Meta-Model framework. This
            meta-data model identifies commonly used entities within a process
            definition, their relationships and attributes. A variety of
            attributes describe the characteristics of this limited set of
            entities. Using this Meta-Model, TWE can transfer models using an
            XPDL as a common exchange format. Beside this interchange, TWE is
            also used for internal representation of process definitions. The
            whole concept is shown on the picture:</entry>

    <para>There is a mandatory minimum set of objects, which must be supported
    within XPDL. This "minimum meta-data model" identifies those commonly used
    entities within a process definition and describes their usage semantics.
    Extensibility is provided by the facility to encompass additional object
    attributes ("extended attributes") which can be included as extensions to
    the basic Meta-Model to meet the specific needs of an individual product
    or workflow system.</para>

    <para>Corresponding to the previous picture with concept of Process
    Definition Interchange, this chapter gives overview of Meta-Model entities
    (<emphasis>Meta-Model framework</emphasis>) and explains representation of
    these objects in TWE (<emphasis>Internal representation</emphasis>) with
    XPDL attributes (<emphasis>XML representation</emphasis>) that are defined

      defined to allow extension of the scope of the Meta-Model in a
      controlled manner.</para>

      <para>All of these entities are maintained by TWE.</para>

      <para>"Resource Repository " is external to the workflow process
      definitions. In some complex processes, participant declaration may
      refer to a resource repository, which may be on Organisational Model
      (OM). WfMC Meta-Model specification defines a simple in-built (Minimal)
      Organisational Model or permits access to an externally defined OM. Note
      that XPDL specification does not define or require a resource
      repository.</para>

      <para>TWE works only with a <emphasis>Minimal Organisational

      In this model, there aren't any relationships between participants. TWE
      may refer (import) any external XPDL structure - <emphasis>External
      Package</emphasis>. That External XPDL file may contain whole
      Organisational Model, so that External Package can act like
      <emphasis>Resource Repository</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>As it is shown in the previous picture, minimal process model
      includes various entities whose scope may be wider than a single process
      definition. In particular the definitions of participants, applications
      and workflow relevant data may be referenced from a number of process
      definitions. The Meta-Model assumes the use of a common process
      definition <emphasis>Resource Repository</emphasis>. Repository holds
      the various entity types comprising the process definition. Within the
      repository itself and to support the efficient transfer of process
      definition data to/from the repository, the concept of a PACKAGE is
      introduced, which acts as a <emphasis>container</emphasis> for the
      grouping of common data entities from a number of different process
      definitions, to avoid redefinition within each individual process
      definition. Each process definition contained within the package will
      automatically inherit any common attribute from the process model
      container, unless they are separately re-specified locally within the
      process definition.</para>

      <para>You can chose to create one package per workflow process, which
      should contain all the necessary workflow processes as well as all the
      associated tools (workflow applications) and workflow participants.
      Another approach is to define just parts of one process definition or
      common parts of several processes within one package (e.g. a workflow
      participant list or a workflow application list), and then to reference
      it from other packages. Within a package, the scope of the definitions
      of some entities is global and these entities can be referenced from all
      workflow process definitions contained within the package. Those
      entities are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Process Definition,</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Participant Specification,</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Application Declaration and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Workflow Relevant Data</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>TWE provides a way to manage above listed entities (within one
      package). On <link linkend="mainToolbarOrganization"><emphasis>the
      picture showing main toolbar organization</emphasis></link>, you can see
      where is the toolbar part for handling the properties of the selected
      Package.</para>

      <para>To create a new Package in TWE, you simply select File-&gt;New, or
      click appropriate button in the toolbar <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/new.gif" />
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject> (the first button on the left). If you are
      currently editing some other XPDL file and there are some unsaved
      changes there, prior to creating a new Package, TWE will ask you if you
      want to save the changes.</para>

      <para>It is important to say that actions represented by buttons shown
      on the toolbar picture (and also corresponding menu items) are applied
      to the currently selected package, which can be the main one or one of
      the externally referenced packages.</para>

      <para>If you select the main package, you can modify its properties, but
      this is not possible for the external packages. These (external)
      packages are read-only, and you can only read their properties.</para>

      <title>Type Declaration</title>

      <para>WfMC assumes a number of standard data types (string, reference,
      integer, float, date/time, etc.); such data types are relevant to
      workflow relevant data, system or environmental data or participant
      data. Expressions may be formed using such data types to support
      conditional evaluations.</para>

      <para>Sometimes set of data types that XPDL provides won't be enough, or
      you want to represent some data type with a special name to easily use
      it when defining Formal/Actual parameters. This XPDL feature allows you
      to declare new data type.</para>

      are the primary method to support such extensions. They are attributes
      those defined by the user or vendor, where necessary, to express any
      additional entity characteristics.</para>

      <para>Extended attributes can be used in all entities which supports it
      by XPDL. TWE provides use of the Extended Attributes like follows: you
      can define "simple" part of Extended Attribute by entering
      <emphasis>Name</emphasis> and <emphasis>Value</emphasis> attributes. If
      you want to define "complex" part of Extended Attribute, which could be
      consisted of tags that belong to the XPDL or some other namespace, you
      have to enter it as a free-text in the <emphasis>Complex
      content</emphasis> field.</para>

      <para>The parameters that end with <emphasis>.ComponentOrder</emphasis>
      are used for setting tab order for each of the TWE frame sections
      (areas). E.g. to add Graph component to be initially the second one in
      the 'Main' tab, it should be something like:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Main.ComponentOrder = XPDLViewController
      GraphController</emphasis></para>

      <para>Note that parameters <emphasis>UpperStatus</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>LowerStatus</emphasis> do not have action order, because these
      areas contain only one component.</para>

      <title>Property file <emphasis>jawetypes.properties</emphasis></title>

      <para>Here are described elements used in TWE: their types and
      information about them (what should be their color).</para>

      <para>For example, the following section defines the properties for an
      activity which type is <emphasis>BlockActivity</emphasis></para>

      <programlisting>JaWETypes.ActivityType.Id.block = ACTIVITY_BLOCK
JaWETypes.ActivityType.Color.block = R=197,G=231,B=235
</programlisting>

      <para>Changing the color used to represent this kind of activity will
      currently have effect only for the graph component.</para>

      <para>There is another advanced feature of TWE which can be utilized
      through jawetypes.properties file. You can define custom XPDL object
      types, and even provide the XPDL template fragment to define properties
      they should have. E.g. if you want to define new type of activity called
      loop activity, you can have the following configuration:</para>

      <para><programlisting>JaWETypes.ActivityType.Id.loop = ACTIVITY_LOOP
JaWETypes.ActivityType.LangDepName.loop = LoopKey
JaWETypes.ActivityType.Icon.loop = org/enhydra/jawe/samples/loopactivity/
images/loopactivity.gif
JaWETypes.ActivityType.Color.loop = R=255,G=155,B=15
JaWETypes.ActivityType.XPDLTemplate.loop = sampleactloop.xml</programlisting>where
      sampleactloop.xml have to be placed under templates subfloder of the
      configuration you are using. The content of sampleloop.xml file can be
      something like:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;Activity&gt;
   &lt;BlockActivity BlockId=""/&gt;
   &lt;ExtendedAttributes&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="LoopCondition" Value=""/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="LoopType" Value="While"/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="BackToPool" Value="false"/&gt;
      &lt;ExtendedAttribute Name="SetTemporary" Value="false"/&gt;
   &lt;/ExtendedAttributes&gt;
&lt;/Activity&gt;</programlisting>To define custom language strings, you
      should edit jawelanguagemisc.properties file in the target configuration
      folder, and add appropriate [key,value] pairs. For the previous example,
      you should add a only following [key,value] par:</para>

      <para><programlisting>LoopKey = Loop</programlisting>If you need
      language specific entries for other languages, you just put
      corresponding property file into the target configuration folder, and
      define the same property. E.g. you define jawelanguagemisc_de.properties
      file if you need German translation.</para>

      <para>This newly defined activity will automatically appear in the
      Graph's component toolbox ones you start TWE for this configuration
      mode.</para>

          actions for closing the dialog) of the element for which he
          previously changed some properties (within the panel), the user is
          asked if he wants to save the changes, leave the panel without
          saving changes or to cancel the action.</para>
        </listitem>

          <para><emphasis>InlinePanel.DisplayTitle </emphasis> - if set to

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>HistorySize </emphasis> - defines the size of the
          previous/next panel history. If set to the value less than zero, the
          history is unlimited.</para>

          buttons.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>There are properties which can be adjusted to fine-tune the basic
      element property panels L&amp;F, such as alignment, TOP, BOTTOM, RIGHT,
      LEFT empty space in the panels, the width and height of the text boxes,
      etc. These are defined by the following set of the properties:</para>

      <programlisting>XMLBasicPanel.RightAllignment=false
XMLBasicPanel.EmptyBorder.TOP=0
XMLBasicPanel.EmptyBorder.LEFT=3
XMLBasicPanel.EmptyBorder.BOTTOM=4
XMLBasicPanel.EmptyBorder.RIGHT=3
XMLBasicPanel.SimplePanelTextWidth=250
XMLBasicPanel.SimplePanelTextHeight=20</programlisting>

      <para>You are able to customize so called "group" panels, used to
      display some complex elements, in order to hide some complex element
      sub-elements. For example, in order not to display Activity's Id,
      Deadlines, Priority and Limit, you should set the property
      <emphasis>HideSubElements.XMLGroupPanel.Activity</emphasis> to the
      following value:</para>

      <programlisting>HideSubElements.XMLGroupPanel.Activity = Id Deadlines Priority Limit</programlisting>

      <para>You are able to customize which elements of some collection
      shouldn't be displayed within so called "table" panels. For example, if
      you don't want to display extended attributes which name attribute is
      "SpecEA" or "EASpec", you can define the property:<programlisting>HideElements.XMLTablePanel.ExtendedAttributes.Name = SpecEA EASpec</programlisting></para>

      <para>You are able to customize so called "table" panels, used to
      display some complex element collections, in order to specify which
      sub-elements will be shown as a table columns. For example, when
      displaying activities, you can specify to show Activity's Id, Name,
      Performer, Type, Start mode, Finish mode and Deadlines:</para>

      <para><emphasis>ShowColumns.XMLTablePanel.Activities = Id Name Performer
      Type StartMode FinishMode Deadlines</emphasis></para>

      <para>There is another customization possible for the so called "combo
      box" panel. Hence, you can define for which elements the combo box will
      be disabled (by default nothing is disabled). For example, if you want
      to disable combo boxes for displaying Activity's Performer and
      Transition's From and To properties, you should specify the
      following:</para>

      <programlisting>XMLComboPanel.DisableCombo = Performer From To</programlisting>

      <para>As with all other components, you are also able to define the
      action order inside a toolbar.</para>

    <title>Customization</title>

    <para></para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Need for customization</title>

      <para>In order to make the life easier for the XPDL developers, and to
      make developing of XPDLs less error prone, it could be a good idea to
      customize TWE. One way of customization can be introduction of new
      activity types (i.e. automated activities for sending e-mails with
      customized property panels for entering all the information, a special
      kind of deadline element, a special XPDL template for creating a new
      workflow process, ...).</para>

      <para>Thanks to its internal architecture, TWE can be easily customized
      in order to support these requirements.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Example - activity for sending an e-mail</title>

      <para>To illustrate previous statement, let's say that in all of our
      processes, we are intensivelly using Tool activity for sending
      e-mails.</para>

      <para>If we use standard TWE implementation, everytime we want to insert
      such activity in the process (i.e. via Graph component), we first need
      to insert a standard Tool activitiy using TWE's Graph component toolbox.
      After that, we need to open the property panel for the activity, go to
      the Type section, and create a new Tool for this activity. When new Tool
      is created, we need to edit it, where we need to select a reference to
      the Application definition for sending e-mails, and than to create as
      many ActualParameters for the Tool as there are FormalParameters for the
      Send E-Mail Application definition. And finally, we need to enter
      appropriate values for this ActualParameters (either a references to the
      variables, or some text expressions).</para>

      <para>You have to admit that there is a lot of work to do, and it can be
      quite anoying if you have to do it many times. Also, it is error
      prone.</para>

      <para>What we can do is to extend standard TWE functionallity, and to
      introduce a new type of an activity for sending e-mails, which will be
      the customization of the standard Tool activity. We can offer a new
      button in Graph's toolbar for creating such kind of an activity. This
      button would have a special icon, and e-mail-ing activity when inserted
      into graph would also have this icon to be diferentiated amongst others.
      Also, when such activity is created, its XPDL content would be
      automatically pre-filled, so it would always have a Tool which would
      reference the Application for sending an e-mails, and this Tool would
      already have a default values for all necessary ActualParameters. But
      this is not all, we can also offer a special property panel for entering
      e-mail parameters (ActualParameters) - e.g, we can have a combo-box with
      a list of e-mail addresses (which could be filled through the LDAP), we
      can have a text box for entering mail subject, and a text area for
      entering mail content.</para>

      <title>Available customizations</title>

      <para>TWE distribution comes with several customized configurations. You
      can switch from one configuration to another one if you select
      Settings-&gt;Configuration and select desired configuration. TWE will be
      re-configured to use selected configuration.</para>

      <para>Available configurations are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>default - default TWE configuration.</para>
        </listitem>

    <title>Extended Attribute Reference</title>

    <para>TWE uses XPDL ability to store some additional information through
    extended attributes. TWE might add special extended attributes to package,
    external package, workflow process, activity and transition
    elements.</para>

    <para>Extended attribute that can be added to any custom main XPDL object
    (Activity, Application,DataField, Transition, WorkflowProcess, Package,
    etc.) is:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JaWE_TYPE - it specifies the custom type Id of the
        element</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Extended attributes added for package element are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>EDITING_TOOL - used to mark that XPDL was edited by TWE</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EDITING_TOOL_VERSION - stores information about TWE
        version</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JaWE_CONFIGURATION - stores information about TWE configuration
        used to create XPDL</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Extended attribute defined for external package element
    is:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_ID - it specifies the Id of the externally
          referenced package</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>All other extended attributes are used by TWE's Graph component, in
    order to hold the information about the graphical properties of elements,
    such as position, orientation, order, ...</para>

    <para>Extended attributes added to workflow processes element are:</para>

 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.</programlisting></para>
